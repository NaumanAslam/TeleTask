//This is my submission for the task, I would like to go through the basic structure and mention a few details here.
Please find the application under the name "Toodl Task" in your device after installation.
1. The app consists of 3 modules, 2 of them are library modules for Restaurants and Weather reporting.
2. The app fetches user location (which offcourse can be improved with more time and focus) and if there is no location available,
then it will fetch an arbitary location pre defined in the CONSTANTS file.
3. The app calls relevant methods from the libraries using the methods and interfaces the result is then populated on recycler view in the app module.

 I have tried to demonstrate that Im well capable of taking care of your Android development, though I understand that
 there may be shortcomings and improvements needed in the code and structure but I can assure you that Im fully dedicated
 towards improving my code quality, as well as in learning new tools and techniques, also I can definitely write something
  even better than this if Im given more time and some resources on it. Therefore please consider this submission as a humble
  effort while I intend to do a lot better and beautiful if I get the chance to be onboard with your team.
  Thanks.
